  abstract = {In recent years, cellular automata (CA) models for urban growth simulation have proliferated because of their simplicity, flexibility and intuitiveness, and particularly because of their ability to incorporate the spatial and temporal dimensions of the processes. Though apparently simple, CA models are capable of modeling complex dynamic systems such as urban systems. Currently, one of the main problems in actually applying CA models to urban planning practice is the choice or design of the most suitable CA model. For this reason, a review of urban CA models applied to real-world cases is provided, along with an analysis of their capabilities and limitations. The review and classification of CA models based on the main characteristics of the models has allowed for the analysis of their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, a discussion of the needs for further research is presented.},
