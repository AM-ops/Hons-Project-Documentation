  abstract = {In recent years, cellular automata (CA) models for urban growth simulation have proliferated because of their simplicity, flexibility and intuitiveness, and particularly because of their ability to incorporate the spatial and temporal dimensions of the processes. Though apparently simple, CA models are capable of modeling complex dynamic systems such as urban systems. Currently, one of the main problems in actually applying CA models to urban planning practice is the choice or design of the most suitable CA model. For this reason, a review of urban CA models applied to real-world cases is provided, along with an analysis of their capabilities and limitations. The review and classification of CA models based on the main characteristics of the models has allowed for the analysis of their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, a discussion of the needs for further research is presented.},

 abstract = {As the dynamo of South Africa’s economy, Johannesburg commands a central position in the nation’s imagination, and scholars throughout the world monitor the city as an exemplar of urbanity in the global South. This book offers detailed empirical analyses of changes in the city’s physical space, as well as a host of chapters on the character of specific neighbourhoods and the social identities being forged within them. Informing all of these is a consideration of underlying economic, social and political processes shaping the wider Gauteng province. A mix of respected academics, practising urban planners and experienced policymakers offer compelling overviews of the rapid and complex spatial developments that have taken place in Johannesburg since the end of apartheid, along with tantalising glimpses into life on the streets and behind the high walls of this diverse city. The book has three sections. Section A provides an overview of macro spatial trends and the policies that have influenced them. Section B explores the shaping of the city at district and suburban level, revealing the peculiarity of processes in different areas. This analysis elucidates the larger trends, while identifying shifts that are not easily detected at the macro level. Section C is an assembly of chapters and short vignettes that focus on the interweaving of place and identity at a micro level. With empirical data supported by new data sets including the 2011 Census, the city’s Development Planning and Urban Management Department’s information system, and Gauteng City-Region Observatory’s substantial archive, the book is an essential reference for planning practitioners, urban geographers, sociologists, and social anthropologists, among others.

 abstract = {Informal settlements have formed an essential part of Johannesburg since its inception, to some extent shaping its growth, often being displaced by formal development but re-emerging elsewhere. In this chapter we focus on the informal settlement situation within the municipal boundaries of the City of Johannesburg, and review changes in informal settlement over the past decade. While the city developed more nuanced data in 2012 and 2013, in part sparked by drafts of the research presented in this chapter, the official and political position on informal settlements in Johannesburg remains that this form of residence has been ‘mushrooming’ or ‘ballooning’.},
