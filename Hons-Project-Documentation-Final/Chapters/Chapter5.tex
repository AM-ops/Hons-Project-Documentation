\section{Advice from researchers}
I suggest that you consider associating remote sensing science, agent modeling  and artificial intelligent dimensions into your studies. In terms of techniques and tools, I would recommend that you consider free ware to create more agility to make changes. Off the shelve and commercial software are not often designed for that purpose and are not always that appropriate for creative modeling for a complex system such as informal settlements.
